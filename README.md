# E-commerce Dashboard
## Brief Overview of the Project
For this project, I have used an [E-commerce](https://www.kaggle.com/prachi13/customer-analytics) dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to develop a Tableau Dashboard that will provide key insights into customer behavior and product shipment data. The project link can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yashasvi7730/viz/E-CommerceDashboard_16415993263580/Dashboard1?publish=yes).
